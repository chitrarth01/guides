## Open Data

Open data is data that is freely available and anyone can _access, reuse, and share_ it.

Following points are important for Open Data:

* Data becomes usable by being available in a common understandable format.
* The open data must be available under open license. This allows anyone to use, redistribute and modify data.

You can extract useful information from open data. _For example_, you can learn any connection between rainfall and doctors appointments.

Open data can help governments, businesses and individuals. It can transform various services, bring socio economic changes, and protect our planet.
